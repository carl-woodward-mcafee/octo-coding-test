# McAfee OCTO Coding Test
This repository provides OCTO coding tests for SDET and Kernel engineers. To successfully complete this test you must:
1. Make changes to the test you have been asked to complete (SDET, Kernel, or User). You must write in C++, no other languages are accepted.
1. Verify that your changes compile. We will not run your code changes, but they must compile.
1. We do not process pull requests. Instead, delete build files (.\.vs, .\build, .\build.intermediate) and create an zip or 7z archive for the entire repository and e-mail the file to your recrutier.

## Requirements
To complete these coding tests candidates must be familiar with C++, Windows APIs, and [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest). Tests must be executable on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

We recommend the following toolset:
* Compilers: [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) >= 16.11.7 or [LLVM](https://llvm.org) >= 13.0.0
* [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) >= 10.0.22000
* [Windows WDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) >= 10.0.2000 and **MUST** be the same version as the Windows SDK installed above.

## Repository Initialization
[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) is supplied as a submodule. Please run the following git command to retrieve the submodule:

```git submodule update --init```

## Build Instructions
Please use Visual Studio 2019 or later and double click on the solution file [octo_coding_test.sln](octo_coding_test.sln). Visual Studio will start and open the solution. If you are asked if you want to upgrade the solutions, chose `Upgrade`.

# The Tests
There are a number of tests in this repository, only do the test that you have been asked to perform.
1. [Software Development Engineer in Test](sdet/README.md)
1. [Kernel Engineer](kernel/README.md)
1. [User Engineer](user/README.md)

Good luck with the test!
